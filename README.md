# Space-Shooter
A side-scrolling space themed shooting game where you control a spaceship, fighting alien ships.

So I made this as a semester project for Computer Science II in my sophomore year at Concordia University Texas.
It isn't finished as I sort of lost direction closer to the end of the project but I have a lot of code in here
and the game works with different levels and worlds and stuff.
